# La Crème Restaurant - Project Context

## Project Info

Name: La Crème (upscale French restaurant landing page)
Repo: https://github.com/Max-Mendes91/la-creme-restaurant
Live: https://la-creme-restaurant.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack

React 18 + Vite
Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 - CRITICAL: Uses @theme directive NOT @tailwind directives
EmailJS for reservation system - @emailjs/browser package
Deployed on Vercel with auto-deploy on push to main

## Reservation Backend

Using EmailJS (email-based reservations)
Service ID: service_dqr6yyc
Template ID: template_zohrjop
Public Key stored in environment variables
NEVER commit API keys - use .env.local only

## Environment Variables

VITE*EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY - stored in .env.local NOT committed
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID - stored in .env.local NOT committed
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID - stored in .env.local NOT committed
.env.example committed as template for setup reference
Always use import.meta.env.VITE* prefix for Vite projects

## Path Aliases

@/ maps to src/
@components/ maps to src/components/
@hooks/ maps to src/hooks/
@services/ maps to src/services/
@utils/ maps to src/utils/
@constants/ maps to src/constants/

## Folder Structure

src/components/common/ - Reusable UI (Button Input Modal LoadingSpinner)
src/components/layout/ - Header Footer Layout wrapper
src/components/sections/ - Hero Menu Gallery Reservation Contact
src/components/reservation/ - Form DatePicker TimePicker ContactFields
src/pages/ - Home NotFound
src/hooks/ - Custom React hooks like useReservation
src/services/api/ - API client reservations.js with EmailJS integration
src/utils/ - Helper functions like validation
src/constants/ - Menu data config
src/assets/ - Images icons

## Services Structure

src/services/api/reservations.js - EmailJS integration with submitReservation function
Validates required fields: name email phone date time guests
Returns success object with reservationId or throws error
All API errors caught and returned as user-friendly messages

## Custom Hooks

src/hooks/useReservation.js - Manages reservation state
Returns: makeReservation isLoading error success reset
Handles API calls loading states error handling success states
Used in reservation form components

## Development Rules

1. Mobile-first approach: design for 375px then enhance to 768px and 1024px
2. Accessibility is required: WCAG 2.1 AA keyboard navigation ARIA labels
3. Use component classes from index.css NOT heavy inline Tailwind
4. Conventional commits: feat: fix: style: refactor: docs: chore:
5. Test on mobile after building each component
6. Use PropTypes for all components
7. Create index.js in component folders for clean imports
8. Never commit .env.local or API keys
9. Always validate form inputs before API calls
10. Show loading states during API calls
11. Show clear error messages on failures
12. Show success confirmations on success

## Tailwind v4 Critical Rules

Use @import "tailwindcss" NOT @tailwind base/components/utilities
Theme config in CSS with @theme directive NOT in tailwind.config.js
Avoid @apply - write CSS directly using CSS variables
Component classes go in @layer components block

## Git Workflow

main branch is production - always deployable
develop branch is integration - test features together
feature/\* branches for new work - always branch from develop
Always create PR from feature to develop then develop to main

## Current Status

Foundation complete: Tailwind v4 custom theme deployed
GitHub and Vercel setup complete
EmailJS integration added for reservation system
Environment variables configured securely
Reservation service and useReservation hook created
Currently working on: Testing EmailJS integration then building full reservation form

## Next Tasks in Order

1. Test EmailJS integration with simple form
2. Build complete Button component with all variants if not done
3. Build Input component with validation states
4. Build DatePicker and TimePicker components
5. Build full ReservationForm component with validation
6. Build Header component with sticky scroll effect
7. Build Hero section with animations and CTA
8. Build Menu section with category filtering
9. Build Gallery section with modal lightbox
10. Build Contact section with map integration

## Reservation Form Requirements

Required fields: name email phone date time guests
Optional field: specialRequests
Email validation regex pattern
Phone validation for format
Date must be future date not past
Time validation for restaurant hours
Guest count between 1 and 20
Real-time validation as user types
Show field-level errors not just form-level
Clear success message after submission
Disable form during loading
Reset form after success
Handle network errors gracefully

## Component Building Checklist

- Use component classes from index.css
- Add PropTypes validation
- Make mobile-responsive with Tailwind breakpoints
- Test keyboard navigation and focus states
- Add ARIA labels where needed
- Export via index.js for clean imports
- Test all variants and states
- Handle loading and error states for async operations
- Commit with clear conventional commit message

## Security Best Practices

Never commit API keys or secrets
Always use environment variables for sensitive data
Validate all user inputs on frontend
Sanitize data before sending to APIs
Use HTTPS only (Vercel provides this)
Never expose backend endpoints in frontend code

## Important Files

PROJECT.md - full architecture and user stories
FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md - complete folder organization guide
src/index.css - all component classes and theme configuration
vite.config.js - path aliases configuration
tailwind.config.js - minimal config for v4
.env.local - environment variables NOT committed
.env.example - template for environment setup committed to repo

## When I Ask You To Build Components

Always use Tailwind v4 syntax with CSS variables
Follow the folder structure exactly
Use atomic design principles - small reusable pieces
Include PropTypes validation on all props
Make everything mobile-responsive
Test accessibility features
Use component classes from index.css first before adding custom styles
Create barrel exports with index.js files
For forms handle loading error and success states
Validate inputs before submission
Show user-friendly error messages

## EmailJS Template Variables Expected

The EmailJS template should use these variables:
to_name - Restaurant name
from_name - Customer name
from_email - Customer email
phone - Customer phone
date - Reservation date
time - Reservation time
guests - Number of guests
special_requests - Any special requests
reply_to - Customer email for replies

## Git Commit Rules

NEVER add signatures or AI references in:

- Commit messages
- Code comments
- Pull request descriptions
- Any files

Write all commits as if the developer wrote them directly.
No "Built by Claude" or similar references anywhere.

## Design Guidelines

CRITICAL: Read DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md in project root before building any section component

Saisei-inspired design system with these priorities:

1. Grand scale typography (text-7xl for hero, text-6xl for sections)
2. Generous spacing (py-24 sections, py-32 hero)
3. Theme colors ONLY (never hardcode hex values)
4. Phased animation approach (structure Week 2, motion Week 3)

Key spacing values:

- Section vertical: py-16 mobile, py-20 tablet, py-24 desktop
- Heading to body: mb-6
- Button groups: gap-4
- Card grids: gap-6 or gap-8

Typography hierarchy:

- Hero H1: text-5xl mobile → text-7xl desktop, font-serif, text-primary-gold
- Section H2: text-4xl mobile → text-6xl desktop, font-serif, text-primary-gold
- Body: text-base → text-lg, font-sans, text-accent-white

Animation rules Week 2:

- NO animations during initial build
- Focus on layout, spacing, content structure
- Animations added in Week 3 polish phase

Animation rules Week 3:

- Use existing classes: animate-fade-in, animate-slide-up, animate-delay-X
- Use useIntersectionObserver for viewport entry
- Use useScrollPosition for parallax effects
- Only animate transform and opacity (GPU-accelerated)

Image requirements:

- Use loading="lazy" for below-fold images
- Use loading="eager" fetchpriority="high" for hero
- Implement blur placeholder while loading
- Grid images use group hover:scale-105 effect

Never hardcode colors examples:

- WRONG: text-[#D4AF37], style={{ color: '#d4af37' }}
- RIGHT: text-primary-gold, style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary-gold)' }}

Component building checklist with design:

- Use .section class for vertical spacing
- Use .container-custom for horizontal constraints
- Use .section-title for section headings
- Typography scale from guidelines
- Theme colors only
- Mobile-first responsive
- Accessibility maintained
- NO animations in Week 2
- Structure and spacing focus

Git commit rules:

- NEVER add AI signatures or references
- Write commits as if developer wrote them directly
- No "Built by Claude" anywhere

When building sections in Week 2:

- Focus ONLY on structure, layout, content
- Use correct spacing from guidelines
- Use typography scale from guidelines
- Use theme colors from guidelines
- Skip ALL animations and fancy effects
- Make it work first, polish later
